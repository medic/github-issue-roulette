# github-issue-roulette

Giant backlog getting you down? All those vague ideas and unimportant bugs feeling oppressive? Don't want to just nuke it all from orbit?

Github Issue Roulette is a silly script to randomly assign old issues to you and your team-mates so you can work through the malaise of backlog hell a little bit at a time.

To use, copy `config.json.example` as instructed, and `node index` when you're ready to fire your first salvo against the enemies of backlog cleanliness!
